# INCIDENT DETECTION PROGRESS

Our team has done a thorough literature review about methods for **traffic incident detection** and based on different attributes like recognition of paper, best prediction rate, data available to us, we have implemented a traffic incident detection method based on article: _Real-time Traffic Incident Detection Using a Probabilistic Topic Model [ISâ€™15]_

This paper has applied specific kind of topic modeling technique called Latent Dirichlet Allocation to model and classify traffic states. It uses historical data to train K traffic states over the whole dataset and then compares those traffic states to specific observations to detect incident.

## Latend Dirichlet Allcoation
### Mathematical Description




1. Topic modeling



2. Bayes to get the underlying model back

### Results

### Multiple Improvements

Current analysis was rather a simple application of a model on available data without taking into account multiple considerations.  

1. Specific states - Tokyo all the same, HK very diverging
2. Other models might act better
3. Social Media
4. Different training for different typr roads.
